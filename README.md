# README

This repository seeks to create a clustering model that selects influencers from our database based on the categories of the post the organisation submits to us through a form submission.

The initial stages of this model will be created with mocked data.

After testing the effectiveness of the model and its success through manual selection during pilot testing, we will deploy a fully functional model that automates the process of selecting influencers.

# Core Feature

Influencer selection based on clustering model (number of influencers selected based on aggregated average likes per post)
</br>

# TODO

## Complete by 13 August

- [ ] Create mock data for data modeling (est ~100 data points representing influencers)
- [ ] Try out the K-Means Clustering model on the mocked data
- [ ] Create 'fake' company posts to test the model's effectiveness in selecting influencers
- [ ] Do a simple analysis on the results of the Pilot Testing *(herbal tea company)*

## Complete by 20 August

- [ ] Deploy a simple model based on the information obtained from earlier testing

*The above checklist helps to create a minimum viable product of the clustering model*

## Eventually

- [ ] Connect the model to our influencer database
